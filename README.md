- How to implement spritesheet animation logic in ECS?
- How to synchronize sprite renderers with entities?
- How to react to UI events in ECS?
- How to implement object-pool for sprite presenters?
- How to utilize [TransformAccessArray](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Jobs.TransformAccessArray.html) to update the transform of sprite presenters in parallel?
